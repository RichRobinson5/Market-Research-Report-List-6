<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydronic Underfloor Heating System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Water Floor Heating</li><li>Wet Water Floor Heating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydronic underfloor heating system is classified into two main types, Dry Water Floor Heating and Wet Water Floor Heating. Dry Water Floor Heating involves inserting pipes into grooves in the subfloor and covering them with a conductive material, allowing the heat to radiate upwards. On the other hand, Wet Water Floor Heating involves embedding the pipes in a concrete slab or screed. Both systems offer efficient and comfortable heating solutions for homes and commercial buildings, with Wet Water Floor Heating often preferred for its higher heat output and faster response time.</p></p>
