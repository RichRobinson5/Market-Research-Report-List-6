<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rat Isolator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Isolator</li><li>Negative Pressure Isolator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rat isolators are used in research settings to provide a controlled environment for studying rats. Positive pressure isolators maintain higher air pressure inside the chamber than outside, preventing contaminants from entering. Negative pressure isolators keep air pressure inside lower than outside, containing any potential contaminants within the chamber. Positive pressure isolators are commonly used for immunocompromised rats, while negative pressure isolators are used for housing rats infected with pathogens. Both types of isolators are essential for maintaining clean and safe research environments for studying rats.</p></p>
