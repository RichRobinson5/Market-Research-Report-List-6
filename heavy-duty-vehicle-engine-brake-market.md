<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy-duty Vehicle Engine Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compression Release Brake</li><li>Exhaust Brake</li><li>Retarder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heavy-duty vehicle engine brake market includes three main types: Compression Release Brake, Exhaust Brake, and Retarder. Compression Release Brake works by releasing the engine's compressed air to slow down the vehicle. Exhaust Brake restricts the flow of exhaust gases to create back pressure, slowing down the engine. Retarder uses an electromagnetic or hydraulic mechanism to generate resistance in the drivetrain, reducing vehicle speed. Each type offers different levels of braking power and efficiency, catering to various heavy-duty vehicle applications.</p></p>
