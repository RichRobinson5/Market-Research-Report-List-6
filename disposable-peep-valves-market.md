<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disposable Peep Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adjustable</li><li>Non-adjustable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Disposable Peep Valves are used to control the pressure in the airways during mechanical ventilation. There are two main types in the market: Adjustable and Non-adjustable. Adjustable Peep Valves allow healthcare providers to manually adjust the pressure level, providing more control over the ventilation process. On the other hand, Non-adjustable Peep Valves are preset at a fixed pressure level and cannot be altered. Both types serve the same purpose of regulating airway pressure, but Adjustable valves offer more flexibility and customization options.</p></p>
