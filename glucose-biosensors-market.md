<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glucose Biosensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG)</li><li>Continuous Glucose Monitoring</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The glucose biosensors market comprises two primary types: Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM). SMBG devices, typically used by individuals with diabetes, allow for sporadic testing of blood glucose levels through fingerstick methods. In contrast, CGM systems provide real-time, continuous tracking of glucose levels through sensors placed under the skin, offering dynamic data and reducing the need for frequent fingersticks. Both systems enhance diabetes management by aiding users in maintaining optimal glucose control.</p></p>
