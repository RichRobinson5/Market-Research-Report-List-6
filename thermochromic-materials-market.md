<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermochromic Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversible Thermochromic Materials</li><li>Irreversible Thermochromic Materials</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermochromic materials are substances that change color in response to temperature fluctuations. The market for these materials can be divided into two main types: Reversible Thermochromic Materials and Irreversible Thermochromic Materials. Reversible thermochromic materials change color temporarily when exposed to heat, returning to their original color when the temperature decreases. On the other hand, irreversible thermochromic materials undergo a permanent color change when heated, and this change is irreversible even when the temperature drops. Both types of materials have applications in various industries such as textiles, packaging, and sensors.</p></p>
