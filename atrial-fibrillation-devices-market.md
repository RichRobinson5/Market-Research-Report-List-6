<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atrial Fibrillation Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catheter Ablation</li><li>Maze Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Atrial Fibrillation Devices market includes two main types of treatment options - Catheter Ablation and Maze Surgery. Catheter Ablation involves using radiofrequency energy or freezing techniques to destroy small areas of heart tissue that may be causing abnormal heart rhythms. Maze Surgery, on the other hand, is a more invasive procedure that involves creating a series of scar lines on the heart to redirect electrical signals and restore normal heart rhythm. Both procedures are used to treat atrial fibrillation by controlling heart rhythm and reducing the risk of complications.</p></p>
