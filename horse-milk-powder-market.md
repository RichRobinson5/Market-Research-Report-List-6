<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horse Milk Powder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Freeze-dried Powder</li><li>Hot Dry Powder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Horse milk powder is available in two main market types: freeze-dried powder and hot dry powder. Freeze-dried powder is produced by freezing the liquid milk and then drying it under low pressure, resulting in a powder form that retains most of the original nutrients and flavor. Hot dry powder is made by evaporating the liquid milk at high temperatures, which can slightly alter the taste and nutritional content of the final product. Both types of horse milk powder offer convenience and longer shelf life compared to liquid milk.</p></p>
