<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Selective Catalytic Reduction for Diesel Commercial Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>NH3-SCR</li><li>Urea-SCR</li><li>Ammonia-SCR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is a technology used in diesel commercial vehicles to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. There are three main types of SCR systems on the market: NH3-SCR, Urea-SCR, and Ammonia-SCR. NH3-SCR uses ammonia as a reducing agent, Urea-SCR uses a urea-water solution known as AdBlue, and Ammonia-SCR injects ammonia directly into the exhaust stream. These systems all work by converting nitrogen oxides into harmless nitrogen and water vapor through a catalytic reaction.</p></p>
