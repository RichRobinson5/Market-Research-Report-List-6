<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrical Plastic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halogenated</li><li>Non-halogen</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electrical plastic market can be classified into two main types: halogenated and non-halogenated. Halogenated electrical plastics contain halogen-based additives, such as chlorine or bromine, that provide flame retardant properties. On the other hand, non-halogenated electrical plastics use alternative flame retardant additives that do not contain halogens. Both types of electrical plastics have their own advantages and disadvantages, with halogenated plastics being more effective in fire resistance but raising concerns about environmental and health hazards, while non-halogenated plastics are considered safer but may not provide the same level of flame retardancy.</p></p>
