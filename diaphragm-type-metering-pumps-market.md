<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diaphragm Type Metering Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Diaphragm Type</li><li>Hydraulic Diaphragm Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diaphragm type metering pumps come in two main types: Mechanical diaphragm and Hydraulic diaphragm. Mechanical diaphragm pumps use a reciprocating mechanical arm to push the diaphragm and pump liquid, offering precise and reliable metering. On the other hand, Hydraulic diaphragm pumps use hydraulic fluid to flex the diaphragm, providing consistent and accurate flow control. Both types are commonly used in industrial applications where accurate dosing and metering of liquids are essential.</p></p>
