<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Femoral Stems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cementless</li><li>Cemented</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Femoral stems are used in hip replacement surgeries to provide stability and support to the new hip joint. There are two main types of femoral stem markets: cementless and cemented. Cementless femoral stems rely on natural bone ingrowth for stability, while cemented femoral stems are secured in place with bone cement. The choice between cementless and cemented stems depends on factors such as the patient's age, bone quality, and surgeon preference. Both types of femoral stems have their advantages and considerations for use in hip replacement surgeries.</p></p>
