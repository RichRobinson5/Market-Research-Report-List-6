<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soft CMP Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Abrasive Type</li><li>Normal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Soft CMP (Chemical Mechanical Planarization) Pads market is segmented into two main types: abrasive and normal. Abrasive type pads incorporate a rough surface to enhance material removal during wafer polishing, making them suitable for aggressive applications. In contrast, normal type pads offer a smoother finish, providing more gentle contact and yielding high-quality surface results without significant material removal. Both types cater to specific demands in semiconductor manufacturing, balancing between aggressive polishing and surface integrity.</p></p>
