<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Optic Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Mode</li><li>Multi-Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiber optic cables are categorized into two main types: Single-Mode and Multi-Mode. Single-Mode cables are designed for long-distance communication with a single optical mode transmitting along the core. They have a smaller core size compared to Multi-Mode cables, allowing for higher bandwidth and longer transmission distances. Multi-Mode cables are best suited for shorter distances, with multiple optical modes transmitting along the core. They have a larger core size, making them more cost-effective for shorter reach applications.</p></p>
