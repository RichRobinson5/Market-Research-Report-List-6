<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distributed Fibre Optics Sensing Technology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OTDR</li><li>OFDR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Distributed Fibre Optics Sensing Technology is divided into two main types: Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (OTDR) and Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR). OTDR sends pulses of light down a fibre optic cable and measures the time and intensity of the reflections, allowing for the detection of breaks or faults. OFDR, on the other hand, analyzes the frequency of the reflections to provide more detailed information about the physical properties of the fibre optic cable, such as strain or temperature changes. Both technologies are widely used in various industries for monitoring and security purposes.</p></p>
